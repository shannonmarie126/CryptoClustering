# CryptoClustering

Unsupervised learning challenge
- using both the KMeans method alone and with principal compenent analysis, cryptocurrency data is grouped into clusters for predictive use.
- Both models are fit and transformed to the crypto data and then scaled using the Standard Scaler from sci-kit learn with the coin id as the index for ease.
- An elbow curve is graphed for both models, showing the best value of k (clusters) to be 4.
